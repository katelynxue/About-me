    <p>In my future I hope I can visit Monaco to see the Monaco Grand Prix. This is one of the most famous Grand Prixs' in F1 history and it would be a dream come true to see it in person.</p>
    <img src="download.png" alt="Monaco" width="400"/>
    <p>I also want to work hard at my job and be able to buy nice things. I want to push myself to work even harder after school, so I can treat myself on occasion.</p>

    <p>For the fall of 2026 I will be attending Amherst College and playing volleyball there!</p>
    <p>I am SUPER excited to experience the college life and I honestly couldn't have asked for a better school.</p>
    <p>I am so so so proud to call Amherst my future home and I am so happy to find a college that fits me.</p>

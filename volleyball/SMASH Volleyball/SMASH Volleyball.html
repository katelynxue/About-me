    <p>I have played on SMASH since I started playing volleyball. This has been the only club I have played on for 6 years!</p>
    <p>I have made so many lifelong friends and I super excited but also very sad to play my last year for SMASH.</p>
    <p>SMASH Volleyball Club has taught me all I know when it comes to volleyball. I can honestly say I have spent some of the best moments of my life with SMASH.</p>
    <p>I am forever grateful for the program and will always be proud to say I played for SMASH Volleyball Club.</p>

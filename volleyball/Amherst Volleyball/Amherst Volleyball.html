        <p>Next year I will attend Amherst College to play volleyball!</p>
        <p>I am so so excited, since Amherst was one of my favorite colleges I looked at over the summer. It was always my dream to be able to play college volleyball, and achieving it honestly felt so amazing. </p>
        <p>I have met some of the other girls in my class through social media, and I am really looking forward to meet the other players on the team.</p>
        <p>I am hopefull that the team will be very good and I can do well in both school and volleyball.</p>
